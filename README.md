Use [JSON Schema](http://json-schema.org/draft-04/json-schema-core.html) along with fake generators to provide consistent and meaningful fake data for your system.

## What's next?

The latest `RC16` comes with some deprecations and breaking-changes towards `v0.5.x` API:

- **deprecated** &mdash; You will not longer be able to call `jsf()` and get a fully-dereferenced result. It will just generate given refs and inline ones, nothing else.
  - `jsf.generate()` is the sync-version, with partial dereferencing through given refs, etc.
  - `jsf.resolve()` is the async-version, with full dereferencing, given refs are also supported.
- **deprecated** &mdash; TypeScript sources are not longer used, however `d.ts` definitions will be updated on time.

Review here: https://github.com/json-schema-faker/json-schema-faker/pull/464

> Most _documentation_ from README.md was moved to `docs/` and it should have its own place there, on the website, or wiki pages, etc. This part is unclear yet, so any suggestion is welcome on the PR above.

## Resources

* [JSON, JSON Schema & JSON-schema-faker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkqiUG3j_Xw) - WarsawJS meetup presentation recording, a step-by-step guide to JSON-related tools, including `jsf`

## Motivation

There were some existing projects or services trying to achieve similar goals as `jsf`:

- http://www.json-generator.com/
- https://github.com/unindented/fake-json
- https://github.com/jonahkagan/schematic-ipsum
- https://www.npmjs.org/package/json-schema-mock
- https://github.com/thaume/json-schema-processor
- https://github.com/andreineculau/json-schema-random
- https://github.com/murgatroid99/json-schema-random-instance
- https://github.com/tomarad/JSON-Schema-Instantiator

...but they were either incomplete, outdated, broken or non-standard. That's why `jsf` was created.
